# Unity48HourJam
48 hour project. No time to document. As submitted.

Entry for Data Persistance. I will be uploading a video walkthrough to showcase this project. This is by no means a complete tool. There are many ways this project could expand and features from the target source missing. 

Features:

1. Replicates source XML files if not already present. On first launch the application will determine if you already have the prereq XML files. If not then they will be written to the project folder location. However it will alternativly look for those files first. Loading any saved changes from previous application runs.

2. On the new character screen you must enter each required catagory for details. After that the Attributes area will become unlocked. You must spend points with a left click on the desired skill. Right click will remove points. Keeping to a max of 5 and a minimum of 1. Spend 7, 5, and 3 points in desired Attribute categories. Once these initial points are spent. Abillities section will unlock.
Spend 13, 9, and 5 points between those categories. At which point you may spend 3 discipline points. 5 background points, and 7 virtue points. At this point the application adds two stats to come up with humanity and willpower scores. Then bloodpoints are determined by a random 1-10 dice roll. At this point you may save the character to the characters xml file.

From the view characters screen you may view or remove characters. The remove feature requires verification. While view will load the stats into a display of the proper game format.
